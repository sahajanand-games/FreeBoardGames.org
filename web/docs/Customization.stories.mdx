# Game Customization 

**This is still in development**

The game personalization framework in FBG intends to allow game developers 
to give user options on rules or AI behavior variations for any game. This enables 
experimentating with game rules, regional variations of classic
games, and other use cases.

There are two types of customization supported by the framework, quick and 
full customization.

## Customization types

### Quick Customization

Quick Customization are widgets that are rendered on the card directly on the
game page. This is useful for most frequently used options that are
very important for the user. An example of this is the difficulty level of AI:

In order to keep a consistent user experience across games, **all quick customizations MUST fit in the same line as the play button.**

### Full Customization

Full customization are dialogs that are rendered when the user clicks on the "gear" icon on 
the game card on the game page or on lobby.


## Implementation

### Defining customization data and React components

In order to add customizations to your game, create a file called `customization.tsx`.
This file's default export must be an instance of `GameCustomization`.
Use the starter template below:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { GameCustomization, GameCustomizationProps } from 'gamesShared/definitions/customization';
import { GameMode } from 'gamesShared/definitions/mode';

export interface QuickCustomizationState {
  difficulty: number;
}

export const DEFAULT_QUICK_CUSTOMIZATION = { difficulty: 1 };

const customization: GameCustomization = {
  renderQuick: ({ mode, currentState, onChange }: GameCustomizationProps) => {
    if (mode != GameMode.AI) {
      return null;
    }
    const state = (currentState as QuickCustomizationState) || DEFAULT_QUICK_CUSTOMIZATION;
    return <AReactComponent difficulty={state.difficulty} callback={onChange} />
  },

  renderFull: ({ mode, currentState, onChange }: GameCustomizationProps) => {
      (...)
  }
};

export default customization;
```

There are some important takeaways from the code above:
- `renderQuick` is used for Quick Customization, and `renderFull` is used for Full Customization.
- `mode` allows you to avoid the widget/dialog for a given game mode by returning `null` in these cases.
- You should have a interface(s) for defining the shape of the customization data, one for each type of customization (`QuickCustomizationState` in this case). This will allow for strong typing in parts reading the customization options.
- `onChange` should be called by your React Component when the user changes some option. The first parameter should be of the type of your customization state (`QuickCustomizationState` in this case). This will trigger a re-render of your component with `currentValue` with the new state.
- The state is saved on user's local storage, this means that you must always support old stored values as the user might come back a long time after your implementation is updated.

Then, setup the reference to `customization.tsx` on your `index.ts`:
```typescript
export const fooGameDef: IGameDef = {
  code: 'foo',
  name: 'Foo',
  config: () => import('./config'),
  aiConfig: () => import('./ai'),
  customization: () => import('./customization'), // <---
};
```

### Using customization data

The customization data as `GameCustomizationState` will be available at Boardgame.io's `customData` on Game's `setup` definition:
```typescript
export const FooBarGame = {
  name: 'foobar',

  setup: (ctx, customData: GameCustomizationState)) => { // <--
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return doSomethingWith(customData) 
  },
```

And also available at the Board injected as `customData` prop:

```typescript
interface IBoardProps {
  G: IG;
  ctx: Ctx;
  moves: any;
  playerID: string;
  gameArgs?: IGameArgs;
  customData?: GameCustomizationState; // <--
}

export class Board extends React.Component<IBoardProps, {}> {
  render() {
```

(**the above interfaces are still not implemented**)

=======
    const fullCustomization = (customData?.full as FullCustomizationState) || DEFAULT_FULL_CUSTOMIZATION;
    return doSomethingWith(fullCustomization.words) 
  },
```

>>>>>>> upstream/master
On AI mode, the customization values are also going to be available when creating the AI bot:

```typescript
import { GameCustomizationState } from 'gamesShared/definitions/customization';
import { DEFAULT_QUICK_CUSTOMIZATION, QuickCustomizationState } from './customization';

const config: IAIConfig = {
  bgioAI: (customization: GameCustomizationState) => { // <--
    const quickCustomizationState = customization?.quick as QuickCustomizationState || DEFAULT_QUICK_CUSTOMIZATION;
    const difficulty = quickCustomizationState.difficulty;
```

It is important to note that the state as well as its attributes might be undefined. In that case, use the default values defined in `customization.tsx` (i.e. `|| DEFAULT_QUICK_CUSTOMIZATION`).
