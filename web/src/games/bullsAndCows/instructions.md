Bulls and Cows is a deduction game where you need to discover the secret code.

For each guess, you'll receive hints.

The **✓** hints are called *Bulls*. For each Bull (✓) that you received as hint, it means a correct digit for a determined colour/shape and position.

The **X** hints are called *Cows*. For each Cow (X) that you received as hint, it means a correct digit for a determined colour/shape, but which was guesses in the wrong position.

If you receive a hint with the symbol **∅**, it means that you guess an invalid colour/shape that is not part of the secret code.

The order of the hints don't mean the correspondent digit.

> Eg: For the secret code **1356**. If you guess **5126**, you could receive the hints **✓XX∅**
> which means you have 1 Bull (✓) for 1 single correct colour/shape and position. 2 Cows (X) for 2 correct colours/shapes, but both in the wrong position each, and, 1 incorrect colour/shape that shouldn't be in the secret code.
