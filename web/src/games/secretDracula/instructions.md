In this game, there is a small Satsang Mandal which has some secret Kusaṅgīs. The Satsangis don't know who the Kusaṅgīs are, but the Kusaṅgīs know each other. 

In each turn, one player is a San̄cālak, and picks another player to be a Sēvak for some Āyōjan (Activity). Then, out of three Āyōjans, the San̄cālak has to pass two Āyōjan to the Sēvak and discard one Āyōjan. Thereafter, the elected Sēvak selects the final Āyōjan to be passed. The played Āyōjans can either be good (💧) or bad (🩸) for the Satsang.

The Satsaṅgīs win by passing 5 Satsang-related Āyōjans, or by killing Kāḷīdat (the king 👑 of Kusaṅgīs). Kusaṅgīs win by passing 6 Kusaṅgrelated Āyōjans, or passing 3 Āyōjans and electing Kāḷīdat as the Sēvak.
